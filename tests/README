Hi, these are simple tests.  For example code, check out the examples
directory.


to run tests, do

$ make test


I'm not sure how effective these tests will be. At least for static
placement of characters it should do all right.

As for automatically testing user input and other dynamic interactions
ncurses affords, I haven't the slightest.
